    "\n",
    "In the simple fully-connected networks we have been developing so far, hidden units are typically simply represented as vectors, i..e., a quantity $z \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, or when representing an entire minibatch, a matrix $Z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{B \\times n}$.  But when we move to convolutional networks, we need to include additional structure in the hidden unit.  This is typically done by representing each hidden vector as a 3D array, with dimensions `height x width x channels`, or in the minibatch case, with an additional batch dimension.  That is, we could represent a hidden unit as an array\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "float Z[BATCHES][HEIGHT][WIDTH][CHANNELS];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The format above is referred to as NHWC format (number(batch)-height-width-channel).  However, there are other ways we can represent the hidden unit as well.  For example, PyTorch defaults to the NCHW format (indexing over channels in the second dimension, then height and width), though it can also support NHWC in later versions.  There are subtle but substantial differences in the performance for each different setting: convolutions are typically faster in NHWC format, owing to their ability to better exploit tensor cores; but NCHW format is typically faster for BatchNorm operation (because batch norm for convolutional networks operates over all pixels in an individual channel).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although less commonly discussed, there is a simliar trade-off to be had when it comes to storing the convolutional weights (filter) as well.  Convolutional filters are specified by their kernel size (which can technically be different over different height and width dimensions, but this is quite uncommon), their input channels, and their output channels.  We'll store these weights in the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "float weights[KERNEL_SIZE][KERNEL_SIZE][IN_CHANNELS][OUT_CHANNELS];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, PyTorch does things a bit differently here (for no good reason, as far as I can tell, it was just done that way historically), storing weight in the order `OUT_CHANNELS x IN_CHANNELS x KERNELS_SIZE x KERNEL_SIZE`."

    "Let's begin by implementing a simple convolutional operator.  We're going to implement a simple version, which allows for different kernel sizes but which _doesn't_ have any built-in padding: to implement padding, you'd just explicitly form a new ndarray with the padding built in.  This means that if we have an $H \\times W$ input image and convolution with kernel size $K$, we'll end up with a $(H - K + 1) \\times (W - K + 1)$ image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it's \"cheating\" in some sense, we're going to use PyTorch as a reference implementation of convolution that we will check against.  However, since PyTorch, as mentioned above, uses the NCHW format (and stores the convolutional weights in a different ordering as well), and we'll use the NHWC format and the weights ordering stated above, we will need to swap things around for our reference implementation."

Instead, we're going to show you how to do this using the handy function `np.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided()`, which lets you create new matrices by manually manipulating the strides of a matrix but _not_ changing the data; we can then use `np.ascontiguousarray()` to lay out the memory sequentially.

    "### Tiling a matrix using strides\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's consider how to create a tiled form of the `A` array by _just_ changing the strides.  For simplicity, let's assume we want to tile into 2x2 blocks, and thus we want to convert `A` into a `3 x 3 x 2 x 2` array.  What would the strides be in this case?  In other words, if we accessed the element `A[i][j][k][l]`, how would this index into a memory location in the array as layed out above?  Incrementing the first index, `i`, would move down two rows in the matrix, so `strides[0] = 12`; similarly, incrementing the second index `j` would move over two columns, so `strides[1]=2`.  Things get a bit tricker next, but are still fairly straightforward: incrementing the next index `k` moves down one row in the matrix, so `strides[2]=6`, and finally incrementing the last index `l` just moves us over one column, so `strides[3]=1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a matrix with this form using the `np.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided()`.  This function lets you specify the shape and stride of a new matrix, created from the same memory as an old matrix.  That is, it doesn't do any memory copies, so it's very efficient.  But you also have to be careful when you use it, because it's directly creating a new view of an existing array, and without proper care you could e.g., go outside the bounds of the array.\n",

Fortunately, it turns out that the `as_strided()` call we talked about above is actually exactly what we needed for this.\n",

But interestingly (and this is the \"trick\"), the third and fourth dimensions _also_ have strides of 6 and 1 respectively, because incrementing the third index by one _also_ moves to the next row, and similarly for the fourth index.

    "There is a _very_ crucial point to make regarding memory efficiency of this operation.  While reshaping `W` into an array (or what will be a matrix for multi-channel convolutions) is \"free\", in that it doesn't allocate any new memory, reshaping the `B` matrix above is very much _not_ a free operation.  Specifically, while the strided form of `B` uses the same memory as `A`, once we actually convert `B` into a 2D matrix, there is no way to represent this data using any kind of strides, and we have to just allocate the entire matrix.  This means we actually need to _form_ the full im2col matrix, which requires $O(K^2)$ more memory than the original image, which can be quite costly for large kernel sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, in practice it's often the case that the best modern implementations _won't_ actually instatiate the full im2col matrix, and will instead perform a kind of \"lazy\" formation, or specialize the matrix operation natively to im2col matrices in their native strided form.  These are all fairly advanced topics that we won't deal with any further in the course, because for our purposes, it will be sufficient to just allocate this matrix and then quickly deallocate it after we perform the convolution (remember that we aren't e.g., doing backprop through the im2col operation)."

And, after thinking about it for a bit, it should be pretty clear that we can apply the same trick by just repeating the strides for dimensions 1 and 2 (the height and width) for dimensions 3 and 4 (the $K \\times K$ blocks), and leave the stirdes for the minibatch and channels unchanged.  Furthermore, you don't even need to worry about manually computing the strides manually: you can just use the strides of the $Z$ input and repeat whatever they are.\n",

    "Hopefully this quick intro gave you a bit of appreciation and understanding of what is going on \"under the hood\" of modern convolution implementations.  It hopefully also gave you some understanding how just how powerful stride manipulation can be, able to accomplish some very complex operations without actually needing to explicitly loop over matrices (though, as we'll see on the homework, a bit of the complexity is still being outsourced to the `.reshape` and it's implicit `np.ascontinugousarray()` call, which is not completely trivial; but we'll deal with this on the homework."
